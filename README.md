- ### Data Collection
The dataset utilized for this analysis has been sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a prominent platform for data science and machine learning resources. Below is a preview of the dataset,

![Google Play Store Raw Data .img](https://github.com/itsmanishjoshi/Google-Play-Store/blob/main/1.%20Data/Data%20-%20img.jpg)

- ### loading Data into Python:
Importing the required library
``` Python

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
df= pd.read_csv("Google_Play_Store.csv")
df.head()

```
![df.head()](https://github.com/itsmanishjoshi/Google-Play-Store/blob/main/2.%20Python/images/df.head().png)

- ### Data Cleaning and processing

Fixed null values

``` python
df = df[~df.Rating.isnull()]
```

Filling na values with average values
``` python
df["Android_Ver"] = df["Android_Ver"].fillna(df["Android_Ver"].mode()[0])
```


Converting some objects types to floating type

```python
#Reviews
df.Reviews = df.Reviews.astype("int32")

#Installs
df.Installs = df["Installs"].str.replace(",", "").str.replace("+", "").astype("int")

#Price
df.Price = df.Price.apply(lambda x : 0 if x=="0"  else float(x[1:]))
```

 Sanity Check - The reviews should be less than the no of installs
```python
df[df.Reviews > df.Installs].head()
```


##  Data Visualisation

Data is visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn, two powerful Python libraries that enable the creation of comprehensive and aesthetically pleasing visual representations.


## Matplotlib
Importing the library
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```
### Boxplot

### 1.Boxplot of apps and prices
```python
plt.boxplot(df.Price)
plt.title("Boxplot of apps and Prices")
plt.xlabel("Apps")
plt.ylabel("Price $")
plt.show()
```
![Apps & Price](https://github.com/itsmanishjoshi/Google-Play-Store/blob/main/2.%20Python/images/Box%20Plot%20-%20Apps%20%26%20Price.png)

 -  During the analysis, we observed that there are a few apps priced significantly higher than $50.
By narrowing the analysis to apps priced under $50, we aim to provide insights that are more actionable and applicable to a broader user base.

Therefore Apps costing less than 50$:
```python
df = df[df.Price < 50]
```

### Insights:
- Free apps generally attract more downloads.
- Paid apps have lower download counts but can achieve substantial revenue if they offer unique features or target niche markets effectively.
- The analysis suggests that a well-executed freemium strategy can outperform a straightforward paid model in terms of total revenue.
